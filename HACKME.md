Pr. Rogers is kind of superstitious person.

It all started with the number 13, but then he also started to avoid the number 7, and after his trip to Japan, he started to get nervous around 43.
Eventually, Pr. Rogers started to get afraid of all prime numbers.

Can you help him write a program that computes #TODO UPDATE?

Make sure not to use any prime anywhere, or he'll know it.



########## EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE (but maybe not) #########


- The prime restriction applies to individual bytes (not the entire register).
- Opcodes can't have any prime in them. Means, in particular, no 0x86 (mov)
- All the rules apply to numbers in hex format and in decimal format. For instance, 0x79 (79 is prime), even though 0x79 in dec (121) is not, it will still be banned.
