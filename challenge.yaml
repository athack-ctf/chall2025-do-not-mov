    Dr. Dexter is kind of superstitious person.
    He really gets uncomfortable around any kind of x86-64 "mov" instruction...

    Can you write a program for Dr. Dexter that computes the sum of any three positive integers between 0 and 100,000?

    Make sure not to use ANY "mov" instruction anywhere, or he'll know it.

    ...

    What do you mean "That's stupid, I am going home"?? Uh, fine ... you're allowed to use at most 4 "mov"!

    ## DETAILS
    - Your program will be executed inside an x86-64 Linux environment with `glibc 2.39`.
    - The expected format of the output is "`Sum: XXXXXXX`" with XXX the sum of three random positive integers passed in `argv`.
    - The "no mov" restriction applies to any instruction in the `main` function, as well as any function called by `main`, except the `printf`, `atoi`/`atol`/`atoll` and `exit` functions of `glibc`.
    - Syscalls are restricted, except those in above-mentioned functions.
